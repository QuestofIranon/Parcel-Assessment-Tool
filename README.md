# Parcel-Assessment-Tool

Working directory for the Parcel Assessment Tool project for the UMKC School of Law.

This is an application for a smart phone and online.  The target user is a real estate developer.  
The application will display viable initial information for the developer, including zoning,
liens, lot dimensions, a geo locator, building envelopes, legal description, PIN, owner's
name and address, school district, etc.  

The goal is to combine all relevatent intial information to the real estate developer
for a one-stop shopping experience.  Hopefully this will streamline the assessment process
and save the developer valuable time.

For the coder, this would entail gathering data from Kansas City's and Jackson County's
free public websites.
